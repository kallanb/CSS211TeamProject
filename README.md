The implementation of several methods is (or can be) the same between
our ArrayList and LinkedList. Write a common abstract superclass
called AbstractList that implements the common behavior and is
extended by both ArrayList and LinkedList. Factor out the common
code from the two list classes into this abstract superclass so that no
code duplication occurs between the two. Use iterators wherever
possible in the abstract code to ensure that the implementation is
efficient for both types of lists.
